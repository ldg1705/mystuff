  <h2><br>What is a Cryptocurrency? </h2>
  </header>
<p><br>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on<strong> blockchain </strong>technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for the secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</p>

    <h2><br> Blockchain technology</h2>
    </header>
<p><br>Central to the appeal and functionality of cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology, which is used to keep an online ledger of all the transactions that have ever been conducted, thus providing a data structure for this ledger that is quite secure and is shared and agreed upon by the entire network of individual node, or computer maintaining a copy of the ledger. Every new block generated must be verified by each node before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories.
Many experts see blockchain technology as having serious potential for uses like online voting and crowdfunding, and major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) see the potential to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.However, because cryptocurrencies are virtual and are not stored on a central database, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by the loss or destruction of a hard drive if a backup copy of the private key does not exist. At the same time, there is no central authority, government, or corporation that has access to your funds or your personal information.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company. These transfers are instead secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.
In modern cryptocurrency systems, a user's "wallet," or account address, has a public key, while the private key is known only to the owner and is used to sign transactions. Fund transfers are completed with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by banks and financial institutions for wire transfers.
The semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them well-suited for a host of illegal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion. However, cryptocurrency advocates often highly value their anonymity, citing benefits of privacy like protection for whistleblowers or activists living under repressive governments. Some cryptocurrencies are more private than others.
Bitcoin, for instance, is a relatively poor choice for conducting illegal business online, since the forensic analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain has helped authorities to arrest and prosecute criminals. More privacy-oriented coins do exist, however, such as Dash, Monero, or ZCash, which are far more difficult to trace.</p>

         <h2><br>Bitcoin</h2>
    </header>
    <p><br>The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch.
      Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto.Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies.
      There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger in the cloud, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Altcoins.
   </p>
    <p>Balances of Bitcoin tokens are kept using public and private "keys," which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm that was used to create them. The public key (comparable to a bank account number) serves as the address which is published to the world and to which others may send bitcoins. The private key (comparable to an ATM PIN) is meant to be a guarded secret and only used to authorize Bitcoin transmissions. Bitcoin keys should not
       be confused with a Bitcoin wallet, which is a physical or digital device which facilitates the trading of Bitcoin and allows users to track ownership of coins. The term "wallet" is a bit misleading, as Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is never stored "in" a wallet, but rather decentrally on a blockchain.
      Bitcoin is one of the first digital currencies to use peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments. The independent individuals and companies who own the governing computing power and participate in the Bitcoin network, also known as "miners," are motivated by rewards (the release of new bitcoin) and transaction fees paid in bitcoin. These miners can be thought of as the decentralized authority enforcing the credibility of the Bitcoin network. New bitcoin is being released to the miners at a fixed, but periodically declining rate, such that the total supply of bitcoins approaches 21 million. Currently, there are roughly 3 million bitcoins which have yet to be mined. In this way, Bitcoin (and any cryptocurrency generated through a similar process) operates differently from fiat currency; in centralized banking systems, currency is released at a rate matching the growth in goods in an attempt to maintain price stability, while a decentralized system like Bitcoin sets the release rate ahead of time and according to an algorithm.

    <h2><br> Public Key and Private Key</h2>
  </header>
  <p><br> The field of cryptography is fundamental to many cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin. Cryptography is the practice of secure communication in the presence of third parties. In other words, cryptography allows for data to be stored and communicated in such a way that third parties are prevented from reading the contents of what has been communicated. Cryptography is utilized in the creation of public and private keys to make cryptocurrency systems a secure network upon which users can safely operate.
  The concept of ownership on a cryptocurrency system is primarily comprised of three interconnected elements: Digital keys (Public key and Private key),Cryptocurrency addresses, Digital signatures.</p>
  <p>The most important of these three elements are a user’s digital keys, because they allow for many of the ownership features that can be found in cryptographically secure cryptocurrency systems. It is important to note that these digital keys are not stored on cryptocurrency networks themselves, and are instead, stored and created by cryptocurrency wallets, which exist independently of the network. These keys are generated in pairs, consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key can be thought of as being an individual’s bank account, whilst the private key is the secret PIN to that bank account.

The public key is cryptographically connected to a cryptocurrency address in the sense that the address is a representation of the public key. It is often the case that the public key is used to generate an actual cryptocurrency address. This address serves as a user’s account identifier to which funds can be paid into.

Public Key
The important aspect to understand about the incorporation of public key cryptography in cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, is that they are practically irreversible. This means that the mathematical functions that constitute public key cryptography are relatively easy to calculate in one direction, and are practically impossible to calculate in the opposite direction. This cryptographic feature is at the heart of cryptocurrency systems, because it facilitates the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures that are essential for ownership on these decentralized networks.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin utilize elliptic curve multiplication as the foundation for their cryptography. Elliptic curve point multiplication is the operation of successively adding a point along an elliptic curve to itself repeatedly. It is used in elliptic curve cryptography as a means of producing a one-way function, which is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, but difficult to do so in the opposite direction. In cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin, this one-way function takes the private key as an input to generate the public key, which is the output. Because of this, owners of a private key can confidently distribute their public key with the knowledge that no one will be able to reverse the function, and calculate the private key from the public key.

Cryptocurrency Addresses
A cryptocurrency address is simply a string of alphanumerical characters that a user can share with anyone that wants to send them money. As mentioned before, a cryptocurrency address is effectively a representation of the public key. An address is derived from the public key through the use of a one-way cryptographic hash function. With Bitcoin, the algorithms that are used to make a bitcoin address from the public key are the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) and the RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest 160 (RIPEMD-160). Beginning with the public key, this string of values is first ran through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to produce a hash, and then that hash is computed using RIPEMD160 to produce a bitcoin address. The bitcoin address, and addresses in other cryptocurrency systems, are what often appears in a transaction between two parties, with the address signifying the recipient of the funds.</p>

    <h2><br> Altcoin</h2>
  </header>
  <p><br> Altcoins are the other cryptocurrencies launched after the success of Bitcoin. Generally, they sell themselves as better alternatives to Bitcoin. The term "altcoins" refers to all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. As of early 2020, there were more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies by some estimates. According to CoinMarketCap, altcoins accounted for over 34% of the total cryptocurrency market in February 2020.
    "Altcoin" is a combination of the two words "alt" and "coin" and includes all alternatives to Bitcoin. The success of Bitcoin as the first peer-to-peer digital currency paved the way. Many altcoins are trying to target the perceived limitations of Bitcoin. An altcoin must have a competitive advantage to succeed against Bitcoin.

  Many of the altcoins are built upon the basic framework provided by Bitcoin. Thus, most altcoins are peer-to-peer. They try to offer efficient and inexpensive ways to carry out transactions on the Internet. Even with many overlapping features, altcoins vary widely from each other.</p>
  <p>As altcoins evolved, distinct categories emerged. Some of the main types of altcoins include mining-based cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, security tokens, and utility tokens. There is also some movement toward separating most of these concepts from altcoins. If that trend continues, altcoins might refer only to mining-based cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin in the future.</p>
